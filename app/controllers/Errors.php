 *      This class contains methods that fetch data from
 *      Model class, these methods are also responsible on
 *      passing data to view, as these methods passes which
 *      views are appropriate for certain method calls along
 *      with necessary data.
 * 
 *      We made sure that methods are name after its purpose.
 *      So it is undestandable what are their process is all
 *      about.
 * 
 *      Comments are quite annoying if put in every line,
 *      whereas comments should be solid and intact but 
 *      informative as this for example.
 * 
 *      if there are confusing lines in the code below, you
